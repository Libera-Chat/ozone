# Sigyn (Ozone): A Limnoria Plugin for Network-Level Spam and Abuse Handling

## Introduction

Ozone is a Limnoria plugin designed to manage spam and network abuse across multiple channels. It aids in enhancing the security of your network by managing users and keeping the channels free from any sort of spamming or abusive activities.

## Requesting Ozone to Your Channel

To request Ozone's presence in your channel, the preferable method is to discuss with a staffer. You could also temporarily request its presence by using the `/invite ozone`, this is reviewed by staff. It's important to note that invite notifications might be missed sometimes. If this is the case, feel free to join `#libera-bots` for assistance. 

Additionally, once Ozone is opped in your channel, you can ask it to unkline a user using the `/msg ozone unkline <nick>` command. This action can be taken within a dozen minutes following the kill/kline. Itâ€™s important to note that it will only work if the user was banned due to abuse detected in your channel.

## Using the Ozone Plugin with Limnoria

Using Ozone as a plugin with Limnoria involves the following steps:

1. First, you need Limnoria. If you haven't installed it yet, you can get it from the [Github](https://github.com/ProgVal/Limnoria) repository. 
2. Once you have Limnoria running, you can add the Ozone plugin to your bot using the `!load ozone` command. 

_Note: If the bot doesn't have the plugin, a 'no such plugin' error will be returned._
