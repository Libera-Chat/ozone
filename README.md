# Sigyn

A Limnoria plugin to handle spam and abuse on a network level.

## Requesting ozone to your channel

The best way is to discuss with a staffer, you could also ask for her presence temporary (duration varies), with an `/invite ozone` (reviewed by staff).

But as invite notification can be missed, feel free to join `#libera-bots` and ask in there.

If opped in your channel you can ask Sigyn to unkline an user, `/msg ozone unkline <nick>`, you have a dozen minutes to do so after the kill/kline, it only works if the user was banned due to abuse detected in your channel.
